# Forewarned is Forearmed: A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents in Autonomous Cyberattacks
![Image 1](image1.png)

With the continuous evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have advanced beyond passive chatbots to become autonomous cyber entities capable of performing complex tasks, including web browsing, malicious code and deceptive content generation, and decision-making. By significantly reducing the time, expertise, and resources required, AI-assisted cyberattacks automated and orchestrated by LLM-based agents are resulting in this phenomenon termed Cyber Threat Inflation from a significant reduction of attack costs and tremendous increase in attack scale. To provide actionable defensive insights, in this survey, we focus on the potential cyber threats posed by LLM-based agents across diverse network systems. Firstly, we present the construction and collaboration capabilities of LLM-based cyberattack agents, which can scout, memorize, reason, and execute autonomous network operations. Building on these capabilities, we examine common cyberattacks initiated by LLM-based agents and compare their effectiveness across static, mobile, and infrastructure-free networks. By analyzing the threat bottlenecks of LLM-based agents across network systems with varying infrastructure types, we review and show that classic defense methods are inadequate due to inherent structural vulnerabilities and operational asymmetries, rendering them ineffective against autonomous cyberattacks by LLM-based agents with minimal human intervention. Finally, the survey outlines future research directions and potential defensive strategies for legacy network systems.
